# Pedometer-Spoofer

This is code for my little robot that moves a motor in such a way that is mimics walking.

This was my first project with Arduino, made in the Winter of 2020. The primary purpose for this was to spoof the internal pedometer (step counter) of the Google Health App in order to progress more efficiently in Pokemon Go.

The schematic was made using the circuito.io app.
