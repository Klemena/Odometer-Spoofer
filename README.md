# Pedometer-Spoofer

This is code for my little robot that moves a motor in such a way that is mimics walking.

This was my first project with Arduino, made in the Winter of 2020. The primary purpose for this was to spoof the internal pedometer (step counter) of the Google Health App in order to progress more efficiently in Pokemon Go.

Usage: Use the joystick (vertical axis) to select how many kilometers you would like the phone to 'walk'. Next, place your device in the holder attached to the arm of the motor. Finally, press the joystick. This will convert the display from kilometers to seconds and begin moving the phone. The display shows how many seconds remain.

The schematic was made using the circuito.io app.
